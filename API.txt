API(Application Programming Interface)

It is a set of rules that allows programs to talk with each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk.

In layman terms, In computers- an API works like a Waiter
You(the app/client) makes a request.
The API takes the request to another program or server(the "kitchen").
That server does the work and gives a result.
The API brings that result back to you.

The response is usually sent in XML or JSON format.

REST(Representational State Transfer)

A set of constraints to be used for creating web Servlets(API).
It is a like a messenger b/w you(user/app) and the server.
